# Why Picard.js?

## The Problems

Today, a rich collection of libraries, tools, and frameworks for creating micro frontends exist. The problem usually do not occur when a micro frontend is created using a specific technology - they usually occur when a micro frontend should be *integrated* into an existing solution.

**Picard.js** enables integration of micro frontends independent of their technology or exposed functionality. It allows you to work with a central directory of micro frontends (e.g., retrieved from a micro frontend discovery service), as well as directly with an URL leading to a micro frontend.
