# Using Web Components

## Introduction

Web components are a set of standardized APIs for creating reusable, encapsulated custom HTML elements. They consist of Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, and HTML Templates, allowing developers to define new tags, encapsulate styles and scripts, and create reusable markup. This promotes modularity, maintainability, and interoperability in web development, enabling the seamless integration of custom elements across different web applications and frameworks.
