# Referencing Pilets

## Introduction

Pilets are the building blocks of microfrontends in Piral, a framework for creating modular web applications. Each pilet represents an independently developed and deployable feature, enabling seamless integration and dynamic loading within a Piral instance. This approach promotes a highly scalable and maintainable architecture, allowing teams to work autonomously on different features and deploy updates without affecting the entire application. Pilets streamline the development process, enhance flexibility, and ensure a cohesive user experience across diverse components.
