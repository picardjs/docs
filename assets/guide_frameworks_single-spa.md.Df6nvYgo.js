It facilitates the creation of independent, self-contained components, each deployable and maintainable on its own. This component model enhances flexibility and scalability, enabling teams to work on different parts of an application simultaneously without conflicts.</p><p>The key advantage of single-spa&#39;s component model is its support for gradual upgrades and technology migrations. Developers can update or refactor individual components incrementally, ensuring continuous improvement with minimal disruption. With its straightforward API and robust features, single-spa simplifies the integration and orchestration of diverse front-end microservices, fostering modular and resilient web applications.</p><h2 id="using-single-spa-in-picard-js" tabindex="-1">Using single-spa in Picard.js <a class="header-anchor" href="#using-single-spa-in-picard-js" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Using single-spa in Picard.js&quot;">​</a></h2><p>...</p>',6),o=[t];function r(l,p,c,d,g,m){return n(),a("div",null,o)}const f=e(s,[["render",r]]);export{h as __pageData,f as default};
