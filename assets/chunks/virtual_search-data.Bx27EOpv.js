So, instead of requiring to set up some bundler or go into specifics, all you need to do is grab a script and add a web component. That's it!\\nFor owners of existing micro frontend solutions the integration of other micro frontends will no longer break due to technology incompatibilities. If two micro frontends have been written - one using Module Federation and another one using Native Federation - you will no longer require some frankenstein solution, but instead can just embed both; and it will just work.\\n"],[57,"Picard.js can work with a variety of component frameworks.

This approach optimizes performance and user experience, combining the best of SSR and client-side rendering.\\n"],[50,"Picard.js introduces its own lifecycle for components to ensure consistent management and orchestration across diverse frameworks and platforms. Each framework, such as React, Angular, or Vue, has unique lifecycle methods and hooks for mounting, updating, and unmounting components, leading to challenges in maintaining uniform behavior in a micro frontend architecture.\\nBy establishing a standardized lifecycle, Picard.js abstracts these differences, providing a unified interface for component management. This independence allows Picard.js to seamlessly integrate and control components regardless of their underlying frameworks, ensuring smooth and predictable interactions within the application.\\nMoreover, introducing a custom lifecycle enables Picard.js to efficiently handle server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side hydration, crucial for modern web applications that require optimal performance and SEO. By defining its own lifecycle methods, Picard.js can ensure that components are rendered, updated, and unmounted consistently on both the server and client.\\nThis approach not only simplifies the development process but also enhances the reliability and maintainability of the application, allowing developers to focus on building features without worrying about framework-specific intricacies. In essence, a unified lifecycle is pivotal for Picard.js to provide a robust, flexible, and framework-agnostic micro frontend orchestration solution.\\n"],[64,"Picard.js is a micro frontend orchestrator. This means, that the job of Picard.js is to load micro frontends, run them, and mount, update, unmount the components exposed by the micro frontends.\\n\\nPicard.js exists as a drop-in script for your website, as well as a module that you can include in your application.\\nHere is how to include the drop-in script in your website:\\n<script src=\\"https://unpkg.com/picard-js\\"><\/script>\\nThis will automatically set up and run Picard.js on your website.\\n::: tip\\nAlternatively, if you don't like unpkg you can also use jsdelivr:\\n<script src=\\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/picard-js\\"><\/script>\\nIn fact, any CDN that uses npm as a source will work.\\n:::\\nNow start creating regions in the HTML for the components of the micro frontends you'd like to display:\\n<pi-component\\n  name=\\"MyComponent\\"\\n  source=\\"https://yourcompany.com/example/remoteEntry.js\\"\\n  format=\\"module\\"\\n  remote-name=\\"example\\">\\n</pi-component>\\nThe pi-component web component acts as a container element to display the content brought in by the component (in this case MyComponent) of the referenced micro frontend (specified by its source, format, and - necessary in this case - remote-name).\\nSince Picard.js only exposes web components you can always safely write them in your HTML.

In contrast to other libraries, frameworks, or tools it does not care how you create micro frontends. Instead, it only cares how to load (and use) micro frontends.\\nWhen it comes to comparisons the position of Picard.js is quite clear:\\nPicard.js should be thought rather as an extensions than a replacement for any of the mentioned technologies.

It automatically handles errors across your micro frontends, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted user experience while reducing the need for manual error management.\\n"],[47,"Pilets are the building blocks of microfrontends in Piral, a framework for creating modular web applications. Each pilet represents an independently developed and deployable feature, enabling seamless integration and dynamic loading within a Piral instance.

Pilets streamline the development process, enhance flexibility, and ensure a cohesive user experience across diverse components.\\n"],[23,"Piral offers several strengths for building modular web applications with micro frontends:\\nModularity and Scalability: Piral's architecture allows developers to break down applications into smaller, independently deployable components called pilets, which can be scaled and managed easily.\\nFlexible Integration: It supports the integration of various frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue within the same application, providing flexibility in choosing the right tool for each component.\\nSeamless Updates: The independent deployment of pilets allows for seamless updates and rollbacks, minimizing downtime and reducing the risk of introducing bugs.\\nStrong Ecosystem and Tooling: Piral provides robust tooling and an extensive ecosystem, simplifying the development process and offering support for common tasks like routing, state management, and authentication.\\nThese strengths make Piral a powerful choice for developing modern, scalable, and maintainable web applications with a micro frontend architecture.\\nOn the flipside, Piral is a full framework and requires you to conform to its way of thinking - starting with the piral-cli. If the CLI is not used, the whole application would be rather cumbersome to build and maintain.\\nPicard.js on the other hand does not require any tooling. It builds upon the strengths of Piral - ensuring modularity and scalability without having to introduce the same rigid boundaries. Picard.js can be mostly used with the ecosystem created by Piral. For instance, the debugging tools of Piral (example: Piral Inspector) just work with Picard.js.\\nMicro frontends created with Piral can be run with Picard.js.

This way, you can choose if you need or want SSR - or if you want to remain at CSR.\\nAs most of the single-spa ecosystem deals with the specific micro frontends, you can just use the ecosystem (incl. converters such as single-spa-react) in your website powered by Picard.js.\\n"],[68,"The feed attribute\\nSpecifying a micro frontend discovery service with the script element works like this:\\n<script\\n  src=\\"https://unpkg.com/picard-js\\"\\n  feed=\\"https://mycompany.com/microfrontends/api\\"\\n  ><\/script>\\nThis will ensure that micro frontends will be obtained from the discovery service in addition to the micro frontends that are directly referenced in the web components.\\n"],[1,"The following web components exist:\\npi-component\\npi-slot\\npi-part\\n"],[26,"The following web components exist:\\npi-component\\npi-slot\\npi-part\\n"],[51,"The lifecycle of Picard.js is defined by the following methods:\\nload (client): Run on first initialization of a component; possibility to load more packages and prepare the environment\\nmount (client): Runs once when a component should be added to the DOM\\nupdate (client): Runs every time the data (input) of the mounted component should change\\nunmount (client): Runs once when the mounted component should be removed from the DOM\\nunload (client): Runs when a micro frontend is destroyed and load for the component was called previously\\nbootstrap (server): Run on first initialization of a component; possibility to load more packages and prepare the environment\\nstringify (server): Runs when a component should be rendered on the server - this has to produce a string\\nPretty much all of these are optional, however, if you want to render a component on the client you'll need to implement at least the mount function.
