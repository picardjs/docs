::: info
Hydration scenarios are covered via `mount` by looking either into `container` (would be non-empty in a hydration scenario) or into `locals` (which would contain a truthy value for `hydrate`, i.e., `!!locals.hydrate` would be `true`).
:::

(1) the `props` are the deserialized object from the `data` property

(2) the `locals` is an (initially) empty object that can be used at will to transport information between the different lifecycle methods; it is created per component instance
