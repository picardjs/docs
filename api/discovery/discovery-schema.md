# Discovery Schema

Discovery service responses following [the MFWG schema specification](https://github.com/awslabs/frontend-discovery) are directly supported.

::: tip
Follow the JSON schema defined in the linked [GitHub repository](https://github.com/awslabs/frontend-discovery/blob/main/schema/v1-pre.json) for making your own discovery service compatible with Picard.
:::

## Schema Description

The returned response has either to be an object with a property named `microFrontends`, which is an object again - consisting of a mapping of names of micro frontends to their different definitions (i.e., one or more definitions per version).

## Mapping of Properties

### Module Federation

To be recognized as a micro frontend using Module Federation the entry needs to have a section `modulefederation` placed on `extras` of the definition. Alternatively, if the URL ends with `.js` and no other type has been recognized Picard.js will fall back to Module Federation.

| Property                  | Description                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `[key]`                   | Name of the micro frontend                          |
| `[value]`                 | The micro frontend definition                       |
| `def.url`                 | Link to the remote entry manifest                   |
| `def.extras.id`           | The global name of the remote                       |
| `def.extras.metaData`     | The `metaData` section of the remote entry manifest |
| `def.extras.exposes`      | The `exposes` section of the remote entry manifest  |
| `def.extras.remotes`      | The `remotes` section of the remote entry manifest  |
| `def.extras.shared`       | The `shared` section of the remote entry manifest   |
| `def.extras.runtime`      | The MF runtime version (e.g., `1.0` or `2.0`)       |
| `def.extras.type`         | The type (`esm` / `module` or `var` / `global`)     |

::: warning
It is crucial that the right runtime version of Module Federation is transported. While a missing `runtime` value could still be inferred correctly, an incorrect one will almost certainly lead to a wrong interpretation of the micro frontend.

### Native Federation

To be recognized as a micro frontend using Native Federation the entry needs to have a section `nativefederation` placed on `extras` of the definition.

| Property                  | Description                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `[key]`                   | Name of the micro frontend                          |
| `[value]`                 | The micro frontend definition                       |
| `def.url`                 | Link to the remote entry JSON                       |
| `def.extras.exposes`      | The `exposes` section of the remote entry JSON      |
| `def.extras.dependencies` | The `dependencies` section of the remote entry JSON |

### Pilets

To be recognized as a micro frontend using Piral (i.e., a pilet) the entry needs to have a section `pilet` placed on `extras` of the definition.

| Property                  | Description                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `[key]`                   | Name of the micro frontend                          |
| `[value]`                 | The micro frontend definition                       |
| `def.url`                 | Link to the entry module                            |
| `def.extras.dependencies` | The `dependencies` section of pilet                 |
| `def.extras.config`       | The `config` section of the pilet                   |
| `def.extras.pilet.spec`   | The `spec` section of the pilet                     |
| `def.version`             | The `version` of the pilet                          |
| `def.integrity`           | The `integrity` section of the pilet                |

### Anything Else

**This is not supported** (right now).

All values in the discovery schema are interepreted as one of the previously three mentioned formats. If you know another format that can be / is transported commonly then let us know!
