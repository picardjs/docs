# API

The following documents explain the API structure of Picard.js. In general we distinguish between:

- The actual component API - what you need to know for actually crafting experiences relying on Picard.js
- The configuration and setup API - what you need to know to customize and build your orchestration behavior on Picard.js
- The internal APIs - what you need to know for betting extending and understanding Picard.js

We'll start with the [component API](./components/index.md).
